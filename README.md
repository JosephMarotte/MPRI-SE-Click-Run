# MPRI-SE-Click-Run

Do you want to test your skills in an old school 2D run and jump game ?
Well you're at the right place !

## Compiling

We use Python 3 to run our game.
If you don't have it already installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
Then after you checked all the dependencies you can run the game by typing the
following command in `/etc` :
```
python3 main.py
```
Enjoy !
